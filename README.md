# Rhino Anywhere

---

## About the Project

**Rhino Anywhere** offers a clean API interface to stream Rhino Pixels from a remote Rhino instance, allowing users to view -- and edit -- models on any web-connected device, regardless of local resource availability. The platform consists of:

- A Rhino plugin that streams a model viewport as video over WebRTC, and listens for incoming commands and manipulation events
- A JavaScript library for establishing a real-time connection to a remote Rhino instance and executing arbitrary commands against the active model
